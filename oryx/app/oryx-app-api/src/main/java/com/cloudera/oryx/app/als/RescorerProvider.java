/**
 * <p>Implementations of this interface provide, optionally, objects that can be used to
 * modify and influence the results of endpoints like {@code Recommend}, {@code Similarity},
 * etc. It is a means to inject business logic into the results of the ALS application
 * endpoints.</p>
 *
 * <p>Implementations of this class are factories. An implementation creates and configures
 * a {@link Rescorer} rescoring object and returns it for use in the context of one
 * of the endpoints' operation. For example, the result of
 * {@link #getRecommendRescorer(List, List)} is used with {@code Recommend}.
 * The {@link Rescorer} filters the candidates recommendations by item ID
 * ({@link Rescorer#isFiltered(String)}) or modifies the scores of item candidates that
 * are not filtered ({@link Rescorer#rescore(String, double)}) based on the item ID and
 * original score.</p>
 *
 * <p>The factory methods take several optional {@code String} arguments. These are passed
 * from the REST API, as several {@code String}s, from URL parameter {@code rescorerParams}.
 * The implementation may need this information to initialize its rescoring logic for the request.
 * For example, the argument may be the user's current location, used to filter
 * results by location.</p>
 *
 * <p>For example, a request containing {@code ...?rescorerParams=xxx,yyy,zzz} will result in an
 * {@code args} parameter with <em>one</em> elements, {@code xxx,yyy,zzz}. A request containing
 * {@code ...?rescorerParams=xxx&...rescorerParams=yyy&...rescorerParams=zzz...} will result in an
 * {@code args} parameter with 3 elements, {@code xxx}, {@code yyy}, {@code zzz}.</p>
